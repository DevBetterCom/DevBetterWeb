# DevBetterWeb

A simple web application for devBetter.com.

## What is devBetter?

Head over to [devBetter.com](https://devbetter.com) to see the live site. Scroll through the home page and read the testimonials. Essentially devBetter is a group dedicated to improving professional software developers of all stripes. We have a virtual community (currently using Discord) and we meet for live group Q&A sessions about once a week (currently using Zoom). We challenge and promote one another, answer tough code and software design questions, work through exercises, and more. This site is used as a playground by some members and its owner, Steve, to provide a real, working example of some of the coding techniques and practices we discuss. This is in contrast to labs, katas, and exercises that, while also valuable, are not the same as solving real world problems with real software in a production environment.
