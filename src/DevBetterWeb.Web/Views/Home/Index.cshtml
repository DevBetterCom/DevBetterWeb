                If you're looking for direction, you'll be given personalized tasks and goals to complete before the next session,

                        right way to do things but he empowers and provides everyone around him with the tools necessary to succeed going forward. With
                        Steve's guidance I've gone from a developer suffering from impostor syndrome to leading a team of 8 engineers with success, and
                        <strong>doubling my salary in the process</strong>. Plain and simple, Steve has changed my career and I could not encourage someone

                        becoming a better software developer and shaping the way I think about software design, development and architecture.<br /><br />
                        (Steve) guided me to build my own loosely-coupled web application using ASP.NET Core 2.0 & Angular 5 demonstrating Clean architecture, <strong>which in turn helped me land a new, better job,</strong> since my interviewers were impressed by the way the application was structured and built to follow the best practices and principles."

After just one month, I am already more hopeful and optimistic about where I want to go knowing that Steve is in my corner.  I have direction, weekly challenges, and he's available throughout the week on Slack for any questions or discussion.  Most important to me is having that accountability and challenge to do the work which is tailored to my goals, and he provides that.  <strong>I've tried doing it on my own and it is tough with all of the other commitments and priorities</strong>.  Steve's a genuine nice guy to boot, easy to talk to and relate with. <br /><br /> I highly recommend taking up group coaching with Steve if you are interested in having an industry leader in mentoring and teaching partner with you to accelerate your skills and career."</p>

                        He quickly builds a comfortable rapport, encourages participation and discussion, and never resorts to high-pressure gimmicks that so often put developers on the defensive. <br /><br />
                        His style actively invites deeper explorations of topics the class finds interesting, while keeping the group focused towards the primary learning objectives.
                        Training from Steve not only imparted crucial skills our team needed, but also left the entire team eager to continue learning and improving afterwards."
